Perl based web application penetration testing tools

_About_

This suite covers a lot of simple automation for penetration testing web applications and vulnerability research. Originally slated to debut in WEAKERTH4N Linux, this code was a helpful way for me to learn more about web application design, functionality, security and more. It is formerly known as the pCrack Suite.
